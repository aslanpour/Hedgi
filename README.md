Serverless Computing for AI at the Heterogeneous Edge

**To be developed:**

A software system for edge computing with the following considerations:
- Edge nodes (say nodes) are single-board computers such as Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano,
- Accelerator devices such as Google Coral TPU can help a node,
- Nodes are powered by renewable energy sources such as solar irradiations through solar panels and store energy on a battery,
- Nodes can simultaneously generate tasks and execute tasks (say extreme edge),
- Nodes are connected to each other for resource sharing in a master/worker topology,
- Nodes are enabled with containerization whether containerd or Docker,
- Nodes are configured headless,
- Nodes communicate to each other wirelessly, but for experimental purposes we may switch to LAN,
- Power/energy consumption of nodes is measured by power USB meters such as UM25C,
- ...
